# Drone Navigation Project

This project implements a drone navigation system using Microsoft AirSim. The drone autonomously flies around an orange sphere while maintaining a specified altitude and constantly points its front towards the sphere. The aim is to demonstrate basic control and navigation capabilities in a simulated environment.

## Features

- Autonomous circular flight around a specified target (orange sphere).
- Maintains a constant altitude during flight.
- The drone points its front towards the target sphere.
- Collision detection and recovery to prevent crashes.
